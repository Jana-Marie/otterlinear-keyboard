# otterlinear-keyboard

Just a smol ortholinear keyboard desgined by an otter for otters. It is built upon an STM32f042, Kailh Choc switches, featuring a Type-C jack and a wooden base. The keyboard measures only 214x84x17mm and has a smol, slim and chic design to fulfill its purpose as tv keyboard for my living room :3

The board itself can be ordered from JLCPCB with all parts populated (if available..), keycaps can be acquired e.g. via AliExpress. The design was focused both on a clean and minimal appearance, and a clean board layout with just the necessary parts.
